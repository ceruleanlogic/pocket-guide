title: Module 1&#58; Creating a PhoneGap Project
---
## Steps

1. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. If you already have the PhoneGap CLI installed on your computer, make sure you upgrade to the latest version:

    ```      
    npm update -g phonegap
    ```
          
      or
      
    ```
    sudo npm update -g phonegap
    ```
      
3. Navigate (cd) to a directory where you store projects on your file system.

4. Using the PhoneGap CLI, create a PhoneGap project named **PGWorkshop** in a directory named **pg-workshop**:

    ```        
    phonegap create pg-workshop com.yourname.workshop PGWorkshop
    ```        

5. Navigate into the newly created project folder:

    ```
    cd pg-workshop        
    ```

6. Examine the folder structure in **pg-workshop**.
    - The **www** folder is where you will code your HTML / JavaScript application. Open the index.html file in a 
    browser to see the default application created by the PhoneGap CLI.
    - The **platforms** folder is where PhoneGap will build your application for different platforms (iOS, Android, 
    etc). The contents of this folder are automatically generated by the PhoneGap CLI at build time so you should never 
    edit code in that directory since it will be overwritten.
    - Plugins are installed in the **plugins** directory.
    - Application parameters (name, author, etc) are stored in the **config.xml**. You can 
    also see the plugins and platforms used in this project by checking the config.xml.
