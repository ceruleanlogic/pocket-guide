title: Module 14&#58; Adding Polish | Configuration Tips
---
This module is going to take you through a couple steps to polish the application and give you some tips on configuration settings to be aware of. 

###Styling
1. Open the assets/css/styles.css and add the following to the bottom to style the header bar, search bar and icons:

        
        .media>p {
            color: #444;
        }
        .bar-nav {
            background-color: #209dc2;
            color: #ffffff;
        }
        .title {
            color: #ffffff;
        }
        .bar-nav .icon {
            color: #ffffff;
        }
        .bar-header-secondary {
            background-color: #eeeeee;
        }
        
1. Test the application

> It looks better, but you may notice the status bar header seems to overlap the space where the application header resides. The next step will address this.

###Status Bar Handling

In iOS7, the status bar overlaps the application views. As a result, the status bar text may collide with the 
application's header text as shown in the screenshot above. You can fix this issue using the [statusbar plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar). 

1. Add the status bar plugin:

    ```
    phonegap plugin add org.apache.cordova.statusbar
    ```

2. There are two options for using the statusbar to fix this issue, via configuration or programmatically. 

In either case, set the *overlay* setting to false to move our app content below the status bar. Also use the other options to set the status bar background style and text/icons to match the app header colors:   
   
Choose to implement **ONE** of the options below:

- **Configuration (config.xml)**
    Open the config.xml file and add the following lines to the end of the preferences:
  
         
        <preference name="StatusBarOverlaysWebView" value="false" />
        <preference name="StatusBarBackgroundColor" value="#209dc2"/>
        <preference name="StatusBarStyle" value="lightcontent" />
            

- **Programatically**
        Open app.js and add the following code at the top of the **deviceready** handler:
        
          
            StatusBar.overlaysWebView( false );
            StatusBar.backgroundColorByHexString('#209dc2');
            StatusBar.styleLightContent();
        

Now build and run the application again to see the results:

###Keyboard Accessory Bar 

We can suppress the accessory keyboard that pops up with the **Done** button on it as shown in this screenshot by using a custom plugin from the Ionic Framework and then use a method to hide it:

![](images/keyboard1.png)



1. Add the [Ionic Keyboard Plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard):

  
        phonegap plugin add https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard
  
  
2. In app.js, add the following code at the top of the **deviceready** handler:


        if (cordova.plugins.Keyboard)
            cordova.plugins.Keyboard.hideKeyboardAccessoryBar(true);
           

3. Now build the application again and test to see the result.

###Turn off WebView Bounce / Overscroll Effect
You may notice if you pull down on your app from the header bar, you will see a black space between it and the statusbar and a bounce effect on iOS as shown below. 

![](images/overscroll.png)

You can disable this effect by setting a property in the config.xml file. 

1. In the root project config.xml, add the following property to the end of the preferences:


        <preference name="DisallowOverscroll" value="true" />


2. Now build and run the application again and the webview (your app) should stay in place. 

###Set a default application icon

You may want to set a default application icon to be used for all the icons in your application. 

1. In the root project's config.xml, add the following property to point to the icon *phonegap_wings.png*. (You can copy this file into your root from the [initial project download](https://github.com/hollyschinsky/phonegap-workshop)).  
        
        <icon src="phonegap_wings.png" />
        
2. Now build and run the application again. If you go to the home screen (**shift+cmd+h** from simulator), you will see the icon is now displayed as wings. You can see that it's also set for the spotlight search.
